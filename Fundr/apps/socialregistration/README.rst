Django Social Registration
==========================

Django Social Registration enables developers to add alternative registration
methods based on third party sites.


Requirements
============
- django
- oauth2
- python-openid
- python-sdk_ 

Installation
============

#. Add the ``socialregistration`` directory to your ``PYTHON_PATH``.
#. Add ``socialregistration`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` settings of Django.
#. Add ``socialregistration.urls`` to your ``urls.py`` file.

Configuration
=============

Facebook Connect
----------------
#. Add ``FACEBOOK_API_KEY`` and ``FACEBOOK_SECRET_KEY`` to your settings file representing the keys you were given by Facebook.
#. Add ``socialregistration.auth.FacebookAuth`` to ``AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS`` in your settings file.
#. Add ``socialregistration.middleware.FacebookMiddleware`` to ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`` in your settings file.
#.  Add tags to your template file::

    {% load facebook_tags %}
    {% facebook_button %}
    {% facebook_js %}

Twitter
-------
#. Add the following variables to your ``settings.py`` file with the values you were given by Twitter::

    TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY
    TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET_KEY
    TWITTER_REQUEST_TOKEN_URL
    TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL
    TWITTER_AUTHORIZATION_URL

#. Add ``socialregistration.auth.TwitterAuth`` to your ``AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS`` settings.

#. Add tags to your template file::

    {% load twitter_tags %}
    {% twitter_button %}


Other OAuth Services
--------------------
Please refer to the Twitter implementation of the signup / login process to
extend your own application to act as a consumer of other OAuth providers.
Basically it's just plugging together some urls and creating an auth backend,
a model and a view.


OpenID
------
#. Add ``socialregistration.auth.OpenIDAuth`` to ``AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS`` in your settings.
#. Add tags to your template file::

    {% load openid_tags %}
    {% openid_form %}

Logging users out
-----------------
You can use the standard {% url auth_logout %} url to log users out of Django.
Please note that this will not log users out of third party sites though. Logging out a 
Facebook user might look something like this:: 

    <a href="#" onclick="javascript:FB.logout(function(response){ document.location = '{% url auth_logout %}' })">Logout</a>

To log users out of other third party sites, I recommend redirecting them further to the OAuth / OpenID providers after they logged out of your site.

HTTPS
-----
If you wish everything to go through HTTPS, set ``SOCIALREGISTRATION_USE_HTTPS`` in your settings file to
``True``.

Other Information
-----------------
If you don't wish your users to be redirected to the setup view to create a username but rather have
a random username generated for them, set ``SOCIALREGISTRATION_GENERATE_USERNAME`` in your settings file to ``True``.
